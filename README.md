## Hello, World!
Hi! I'm Biarder.  
I'm not good at programming that much, but I love to do it.  
I could use these languages:  
- `C (not C++)`
- `Python (discord.py, flask)`
- `JS`
- `HTML/CSS`
Currently Studing NestJS.

I use GNOME on Arch linux.
And for server, I use Debian.

And I love vim.
It's best editor in the world!
You should try it.
